const bio = `Jo Ann is a writer and former English teacher who calls Scott Township, Pennsylvania home. She spent many years teaching at Lakeland High School, then had the chance to teach in China as the first fluent English teacher at a public high school of over 3,000 students—an experience she loved so much that she returned six times to serve at an orphanage. Her writing is rooted in faith and in the idea of "the Walk": how we choose to live our lives. She shares stories on her blog, On Layton: The View from My Front Porch, named after the road she lives on in Northeastern Pennsylvania. She likes to say that if you keep your eyes open, the world is full of stories worth telling.`;
